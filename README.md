# My personal website

> It all started with an idea of learning CSS Grid. Then one day I saw an oldschool teletext page on a TV screen and this gave me an idea.

## Further ideas

* It's a Vue.js project for now. Willing to decouple it from frameworks and distribute it as a vanilla JS project.

* Display summaries of the most recent blog posts on blog page (300) automatically

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
